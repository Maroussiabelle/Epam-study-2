The sun is rising
My shadow is getting shorter
I'm chasing the horizon
Trying to cross that border.

Been to all the time zones from the Poles to the tropics
I’m chasing the horizon, feeling so myopic

Twenty five thousand miles multiplied several times
That’s the length of my way full of precipices and heights
